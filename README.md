## About

This repository is done in collaberation with Client Circle as a mini project to showcase my Ruby on Rails skills. The goal of this project was to create a site where users can be created, and said users can create, read, update, and delete this objects along with being able to share the object with other users. To do this I created a site for user to create and view personal trading cards
